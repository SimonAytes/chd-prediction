# CHD Prediction

## Project Overview
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 12 million people die every year as a result of heart disease. In the United States, heart disease (HD) is the leading cause of death with 696,962 HD-related deaths occurring in 2020 alone. HD is a highly preventable cause of death. Early intervention and lifestyle changes can play a key role in increasing the survivability of HD.

From 1948 until 1952, researchers in the US recruited 5,209 participants living in Framingham, Massachusetts to partake in a study on CHD outcomes. Participants' vitals were logged at intake, providing 15 of the data's 17 attributes. After 10-years, the researchers followed up with the participants and logged whether or not they had developed CHD in the time since they were first evaluated.

For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle that includes some of the data from the Framingham Study.Though the data is not publicly available, and can only be obtained upon special request, this Kaggle dataset contains a reasonable subset of the original data.
